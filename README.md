# WDI Submit Homework Gem

For early in the class, before we really explain `git` and GitHub.

## Installation

```bash
gem install wdi-submit-hw
```

## Use

```bash
cd repo_with_homework_in_it
touch new_file
git add new_file
git commit -m "changes"
submit_hw # the executable name is different from the gem name
```
